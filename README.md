# TalkRise OrderMan Project
This is a reference project used in the TalkRise React course. It allows users to perform CRUD management on *Customers* and *Orders* like an System Administrator would on an order management platform.

## Requirements

This project aims to stay compatible with the latest
[Node LTS Release](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS), which at the time of last testing was Node 6.

Specifically, this project uses:

* Node v6.10.3
* npm v.3.10.10

You will also need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

## Setup

**There are two ways to start learning on this project:**

1. *Fork it* (Recommended)
2. *Clone it* (This will prohibit you from deploying your changes to a production environment)

**We recommend forking this project in order to push your changes to your own production environment.**

**This project is accompanied by a Node-Express backend that serves as the API for this React front-end. You will need to run this API to retrieve stock information.**

The API and instructions to configure it are available [here](https://github.com/TalkRise/React_OrderMan_API).

## Instructions

The `master` branch is your starting point on this project. After you create your fork, this is where you should begin writing code.

There are also 3 other branches, `m1_complete`, `m2_complete`, and `m3_complete`. Each of these branches is our reference solution to the requirements in milestones 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

While you are doing your work in `master`, feel free to look at our solutions for guidance on each milestone.

*Note:* Our reference solution is just 1 possible way to build your app. If you feel the desire to write something differently, do it!

In the [Milestones](#milestones) section below, you will see links to the explicit instructions for each milestone. You will also find links to our solutions deployed on Heroku.
